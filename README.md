This is my personal website, built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with the [Bloomfolio theme](https://github.com/lauroguedes/bloomfolio/blob/main/src/content/projects/mary-ui-laravel-starter-kit.md).

You can run in dev mode with:

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

And you can build with `npm run build`
